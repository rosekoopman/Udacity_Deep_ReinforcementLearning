# Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree

This repository contains my work for the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) offered by Udacity. Three projects are included:

- project 1 *Navigation*: An agent moves in a 2D world scattered by bananas. The aim is to avoid all bananas. The DQN and DDQN algorithms are used to train the agent. 

- project 2 *Reacher*: An agent with a double jointed arm tries to follow an moving object. The aims is to keep the tip of the arm on the object at all times. The DDPG algorithm is used to train the agent. 

- project 3 *Tennis*: In this multiagent environment two agent are playing a game of tennis. The aim is to keep the ball in the game as long as possible. The MADDPG and DDPG algorithms are used to train the agents.
